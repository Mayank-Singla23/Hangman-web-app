# Hangman-web-app

The "Hangman-web-app" project offers a classic Hangman game experience implemented entirely using web technologiesâ€”HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players are presented with a word to guess, accompanied by a hint. They select letters to uncover the hidden word, with visual feedback provided for correct and incorrect guesses. The game features an intuitive user interface, responsive design for various screen sizes, and sound effects to enhance the gaming experience. With its clean codebase and modular structure, this project serves as an excellent example for learning web development fundamentals and game implementation techniques. Whether for educational purposes or entertainment, the Hangman Game project promises hours of interactive fun for players of all ages.
